## Motivation
My motivations in building this project were to showcase what I've learned so far and to have somewhat of a "sandbox" to experiment and build within. I was able to learn new libraries, and I also believed that building a project with a much bigger codebase than my preceding ones and learning how to organise such a codebase could set me off better for work in a business environmentâ€”and it did.
